TrashTesla
TrashTesla is an ESP32 Arduino program that opens the charging port of any parked Tesla to remind you if trash is getting picked up today! Because if fascism belongs in the trash, let’s open the charging port of Musk’s financial source and let the reminder flow.

Features
Opens the charging port of any parked Tesla.
Uses an ESP32 + CC1101 RF module to communicate wirelessly.
Reminds you about trash pickup day by triggering the port's opening.
A fun, techy way to remind us that fascism and trash both belong in the same place.
Hardware Required
ESP32: The brain of the operation.
CC1101 RF module: For wireless communication.
A Tesla (parked, of course) 

How It Works
When the program runs, it communicates with the Tesla’s charging port to open it.
If the port opens, it’s a reminder to check your curb because it’s trash pickup day!
Simple as that: Trash day just got smarter!

Hooking Up the RF Module
To connect the CC1101 RF module to the ESP32, follow the detailed hookup guide provided in the TeslaTaunter repository.

Also, if you're wondering why this is a great reminder to put out the trash — well, Tesla’s financial success is helping fund some pretty questionable ideas (looking at you, Musk and your fascist leanings). So, let’s make sure the trash gets picked up, both literally and metaphorically.
