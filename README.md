TrashTesla

TrashTesla is an ESP32 Arduino program that opens the charging port of any parked Tesla to remind you if trash is getting picked up today! Because if fascism belongs in the trash, let’s open the charging port of Musk’s financial source and let the reminder flow.


Hooking Up the RF Module:

To connect the CC1101 RF module to the ESP32, follow the detailed hookup guide provided in the TeslaTaunter repository.

Setting up your trash reminder:

Your trash day will be fetched via an ics file. Please edit the code for the ical file fitting you needs.

Also, if you're wondering why this is a great reminder to put out the trash — well, Tesla’s financial success is helping fund some pretty questionable ideas (looking at you, Musk and your fascist leanings). So, let’s make sure the trash gets picked up, both literally and metaphorically.
